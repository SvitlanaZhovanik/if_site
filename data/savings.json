  "description": "A \"Savings Account\" is similar to a bank deposit account, earning interest and offering the option to manage client funds while sharing profits with them. Any deposit into the account will be locked for 12 months, as per the agreement. During this agreed-upon period, clients can withdraw money from their available balance (dividends), withdrawals allowed throughout the agreed period."
